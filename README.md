# Predicting Bank Customers Churn

The aim is to predict whether a bank's customers leave the bank or not. Machine learning models were evaluated and compared according to their success rates in the project performed on the data set named "Churn_Modelling". The event that defines customer cancellation is the customer closing his bank account.
